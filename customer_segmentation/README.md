# Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project involves performing customer segmentation using a clustering algorithm on a retail dataset. The goal is to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior.

## Dataset
- [Mall Customers Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) from Kaggle.

## Analysis
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and selected relevant columns.
- **Feature Scaling:** Scaled features using StandardScaler.
- **Clustering:** Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers into different groups.
- **Visualization:** Visualized customer segments using Seaborn.

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the dataset from the provided link.
3. Install the required libraries (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
4. Run the Jupyter notebook in `customer_segmentation.ipynb`.

## Results
- Identified distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
- Provided insights for targeted marketing strategies.
